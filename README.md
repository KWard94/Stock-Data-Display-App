#### This is a NYSE Stock Data App!
Welcome, this will be an app built in React to display stock data from the New York Stock Exchange!

## Link to Deployed Site
Link: https://nyse-stock-data.herokuapp.com/

## App description
This site is populated by the IEX Cloud API for stock data.

## Link to the API

## User Stories
- As a casual user, I would like to be able to see popular stocks displayed on the main page so I can keep an eye on the companies that interest me.

- As an intermediate user, I would like to be able to open some of the popular stocks so that I can dig deeper and learn more about the companies displayed.

- As an advanced user I would like to be able to search for a company that interests me, so that I can learn about a specific stock, or look up a company that is on my portfolio.

## MVP Goals
- Display updated API data for stocks

- Display popular or predetermined stocks on the homepage

- Display the stock symbol as a dynamic element

- Have the option to select a company to see a more detailed view of the stock data

## Stretch Goals
- Include a search function to search for stocks by ticker

- Create a "portfolio" section to be able to store a collection of  stocks

- Display a change in price from the previous day, displayed in red or green

- Display stocks dynamically on the home page based on companies that have the largest % change in their price (market movers)

- Include code to allow this webite to adapt to smaller screens and be mobile friendly and for different screen sizes.


## My Challenges
- I had a challenge with git branches and being able to push my commits to Github

- I had a challenge with connecting my hidden API key as a variable into my code

- I had a challenge with my API calls only running properly once, and the app would break if the page was refreshed

- I had a hard time getting my search to work, I was able to get the slug to reflect the user input in the searchbar, but could not render it to the page with data.

## My Wins and Successes
- I was happy that I was able to properly display a collection of stocks and some basic data about the companies on my home page.

- I feel as though this project came together as a more polished and complete website, compared to my previous project.

## Things I Would do Differently Next Time
- I would try to code this website as a map function to display information from the API with only one API call. This would make the code more DRY.

## Getting Started
Check out the site! Fork and clone the repository, and run the application!
