## User Stories
-As a casual user, I would like to be able to see popular stocks displayed on the main page so I can keep an eye on the companies that interest me.
-As an intermediate user, I would like to be able to open some of the popular stocks so that I can dig deeper and learn more about the companies displayed.
-As an advanced user I would like to be able to search for a company that interests me, so that I can learn about a specific stock, or look up a company that is on my portfolio.
## MVP Goals
-display updated API data for stocks
-display popular or predetermined stocks on the homepage
-display the stock ticker as a dynamic element
-have the option to select a company to see a more detailed view of the stock data
## Stretch Goals
-include a search function to search for stocks by ticker
-create a "portfolio" section to be able to store a collection of  stocks
-display a change in price from the previous day, displayed in red or green
-display stocks dynamically on the home page based on companies that have the largest % change in their price (market movers)
-include a section for global currencies, if the data is in the API

## My Challenges
-I had a challenge with git branches and being able to push my commits to Github
-I had a challenge with connecting my hidden API key as a variable into my code
-I had a challenge with my API calls only running properly once, and the app would break if the page was refreshed

## My Wins and Successes
-I was happy that I was able to properly display a collection of stocks and some basic data about the companies on my home page.
## Things I Would do Differently Next Time
